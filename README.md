# RECORD System Electronics Enclosure
Contained here are all files associated with the RECORD electronics enclosure. This "box" was designed to fit two MSP430-FR2355 microcontrollers, one 8-channel relay module, and our RECORD printed circuit board. The box is designed to hold each of these components down using 3.0 mm - 3.3 mm machine screws. Screw holes need to be drilled on the bottom half of the box for the relay module and microcontrollers. No drilling is needed for the top half of the box where the printed circuit board is affixed to. Four pegs hold the box shut, and can be secured using the same 3.0 mm or 3.3 mm machine screws.
